	<!-- Note, cannot create magic weapons without selecting a base weapon class (longsword, warhammer etc.) This ties weapon damage rolls to the
	base weapon class which cannot be changed. If the new magic item has a damage roll that is different from its base class then a placeholder
	weapon class must be defined to allow the weapon properties to be defined.-->

			<p>This +1 warhammer was made for a cleric of Lathander, the god of dawn. The head of the warhammer is shaped
				like a sunburst and made of solid brass. Named Lightbringer, this weapon glows as bright as a torch when its wielder commands.
				While glowing, the warhammer deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage to undead creatures.</p>

		<description>
			<p>An exquisitely made serrated dagger which belonged to a member of Neverwinter nobility centuries ago.
				Although reluctant to share its secrets, the dagger is with some sort of magical aura connected to a long forgotten prophecy.
				Upon exposure to moonlight an inscription on the blade appears reading: </p>

	<description>
		<p>"This Scythe is made from a black metal with grey waves giving it a dark marble look. Thought to be forged from the Moon itself, the point where the handle meets the blade is disconnected, and only a small blue stone holds the pieces together. It is cratered like that of the Moon. On the handle there are four runes that glow when held, each representing the previous owners. Currently, one shines blue while the rest are silver. A symbol of Tyr hangs by a silver chain wrapped around the blade"</p>

		<p>When attuned to Moonblade, you have a +2 to attack and damage rolls with this weapon.</p>

		<p><b>Essence of Courage. </b>While holding this weapon, you cannot be frightened</p>
