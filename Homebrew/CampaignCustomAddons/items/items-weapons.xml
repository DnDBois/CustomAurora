	<!-- Note, cannot create magic weapons without selecting a base weapon class (longsword, warhammer etc.) This ties weapon damage rolls to the
	base weapon class which cannot be changed. If the new magic item has a damage roll that is different from its base class then a placeholder
	weapon class must be defined to allow the weapon properties to be defined.-->

			<p>This +1 warhammer was made for a cleric of Lathander, the god of dawn. The head of the warhammer is shaped
				like a sunburst and made of solid brass. Named Lightbringer, this weapon glows as bright as a torch when its wielder commands.
				While glowing, the warhammer deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage to undead creatures.</p>

		<description>
			<p>An exquisitely made serrated dagger which belonged to a member of Neverwinter nobility centuries ago.
				Although reluctant to share its secrets, the dagger is with some sort of magical aura connected to a long forgotten prophecy.
				Upon exposure to moonlight an inscription on the blade appears reading: </p>
