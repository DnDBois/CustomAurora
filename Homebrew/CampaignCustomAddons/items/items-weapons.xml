	<!-- Note, cannot create magic weapons without selecting a base weapon class (longsword, warhammer etc.) This ties weapon damage rolls to the
	base weapon class which cannot be changed. If the new magic item has a damage roll that is different from its base class then a placeholder
	weapon class must be defined to allow the weapon properties to be defined.-->

				like a sunburst and made of solid brass. Named Lightbringer, this weapon glows as bright as a torch when its wielder commands.
				While glowing, the warhammer deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage to undead creatures.</p>

			<p>An exquisitely made serrated dagger which belonged to a member of Neverwinter nobility centuries ago.
				Although reluctant to share its secrets, the dagger is with some sort of magical aura connected to a long forgotten prophecy.
				Upon exposure to moonlight an inscription on the blade appears reading: </p>

    <description>
        <p>The Hammer of the All-Father was created by Moradin himself to protect the dwarven people. Only the finest of dwarves on the most noble of quests can answert the call of such a powerful and potent weapon. It is said that the extent of the hammer's power is unknown.</p>
		<p>When attuned to the Hammer of the All-Father you have +2 to attack and damage rolls with this weapon and it gains the thrown property (range 20/60). When weilding the Hammer of the All-Father you can use your Wisdom modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, for attack and damage rolls.</p>
		<p>When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 damage, or 2d8 damage if it is a Giant. Immediately after you make a ranged attack the weapon flies back into the user's hand.</p>
        <p>This warhammer has 9 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges, using your spell save DC: <em>Thunderous Smite</em> (1 Charge), <em>Moonbeam</em> (2 Charges), or <em>Stone Shape<em> (4 Charges).</p>
		<p>Spells that can be upcast by spending a number of charges equal to the upcast level. For example, to cast Moonbeam at 3rd Level you must use 3 Charges instead of 2.</p>
		<p class="indent">The staff regains 1d8 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
