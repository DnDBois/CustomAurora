			<p>This shield emits a faint, holy glow when wielded and recognizes your devotion to a higher power. When you attune to this shield, the emblem adorning its face changes to one that represents your chosen diety, allowing you to use the shield as a holy symbol. You gain a +1 bonus to your AC while wielding this shield in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>While wielding the shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to to shatter into countless fragments of pure light. The pieces of light protect you as if you were wielding the shield, leaving your hands free. The light surrounds you for 1 minute, until you dismiss the effect as a bonus action, or until you fall unconscious or die, at which point the shield rematerializes on the ground at your feet or into your hand if you have one free. If your holy symbol is emblazoned or attached to the shield, it floats prominently amidst the shards of light and continues to function as a spellcasting focus. Undead creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls made against you while you're surrounded by the light in this way. The surrounding shards of light cast bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet. Once this property of the shield has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.</p>
